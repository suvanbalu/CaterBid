# CaterBid

The Cater Bid application is a platform that allows users to post catering orders and receive bids from catering companies (similar to freelancing).
It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for both catering companies and individuals seeking catering services.
